# Insult Generator

This is a simple Python program that randomly selects an insult from a text file containing a list of insults. Each insult is separated by a new line. The program is designed to be a fun and light-hearted way to generate creative and humorous insults.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/MikoInSpace/insult-generator.git

2. Place your list of insults in a file named `insults.txt` in the same directory as the script. Each insult should be on a new line.

3. Run the program using Python:

python insult_generator.py

4. The program will randomly select an insult from the `insults.txt` file and display it.

## Example

Assuming you have a `insults.txt` file like this:

Fuck
Shit
Damn

Running the program might result in:
Random insult: bull


Feel free to customize the insults in the `insults.txt` file to your liking!
